# First Node Calendar Project
This project uses Evo-calendar and FullCalendar.io libraries to create a calendar of event. Note that we are using Bizzabo's public API.

## Instructions
Clone Calendar-Project and:
1.	Download Node.js 
2.	Run the command below on the root of the downloaded folder to install the dependencies:
npm install
3.	In order to add the API key, rename the ".env_sample" file as ".env" and replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your API key [Note: do not need to type “Bearer” in front of the key]. 
4.	Run the command below to start the web application
npm start
5.	Open on the browser:  http://localhost:7000/evo or http://localhost:7000/full
